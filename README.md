## About CMS Theme / Template Editor
#### Name: CMS-T-Editor
#### Version: 0.0.5
#### PHP Version: 8.1 ready
#### No Database required
#### Author:  Andreas Holzer / @WebCrew / https://github.com/WebCrew
#### Description: Thats a code editor with integrated file manager based on ACE and Emmet which you can use to code or edit a project online. You can also load the editor into the Themes folder of a CMS or Forum Script and then use it as a CMS / Forum Theme or better said Code Editor.



## Requirements

1. A FTP Programm like FileZilla To Upload the Editor Folder and Files into Your CMS / Forum Theme Folder. Or to upload it on Your Server to use it as a online Web-Editor with File Manager.
	
2. Best Use with Firefox Browser, as in Chrome it will (maybe) give some error (to prevent xss attack) while saving a file which has js in it (Google policies).



## Some Features Of The Editor

If you know the ACE editor and also have an idea of Emmet, then you already know many of the possibilities that the editor offers because it is based on these systems. 



#### With The File Manager You Can ...

1. rename, upload, edit or delete a file
2. create, rename or delete a folder



#### With The Text Editor You Can ...

1. edit a file
2. save a file
3. list the directory
4. change base folder for sidebar view
5. rename of a file
6. select document type
7. select font size
8. select theme
9. Clt + S (save enabled)
10. open folder icon
11. set the document type (php, css, script, html, text, sass, less)
12. font and theme selection saved in cookies
13. make use of lots of keyboard shortcuts (press clt+alt+h to view keyboard shortcuts)
14. Emmet enabled (cheatcodes: https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)



## How To Use

1. Use as a Default Web-Editor: Unzip my Editor Files and upload all Files on your Server. Now run https://yourdomain/cms-t-editor.php and login with the password: password
	
2. Use as a CMS / Forum Theme Editor: unzip my Editor Files then upload all files with a FTP Programm into the Theme Folder of Your CMS or Forum. Depending on which CMS or which forum you use, you still have to integrate the following: Ask the developer how to create a menu link in the CMS backend called for example "Theme Editor". Also ask the developer what to do so that the cms-t-editor.php page with the link you created and the Editor will be displayed in the CMS backend. Now You see the editors Login Form. Loginn with the default password: password. Thats it.
	
3. Note again, the login Password is: password
	
4. steps to change the password:
- convert your new password in md5 hash (You can us: https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/)
- find the below code in cms-t-editor.php  (its around line 126)
- if(md5($_POST['password']) == '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'){
- replace **5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99** with your new hash


	   
## Whats next on the ToDo list

1. I wanted to integrate TogetherJs to give the editor a collaborative feature - to work in a team. Unfortunately, TogetherJS is no longer active and the community servers often have failures. So far there is no really good alternative - maybe you have one? In any case, I'll keep an eye on that.

2. Another thing is that I want to integrate a simple image editor, also for .svg files. I already have one on my harddrive.
    
    3. The CSS should definitely be 100% responsive - so far it has unfortunately only partially fulfilled the requirement. So if you are interested, you are welcome to do so and help - thank you very much.
